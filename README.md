The four replicates of the short term (R1, R2) and long term (R6, R7) turbidostat runs. OD600 values were constantly monitored and maintained at 0.8. Samples were taken every 12 h. Dips in OD600 values represent sampling points. At each sampling point, ⅔ of the turbidostat volume was extracted for duplex sequencing.
